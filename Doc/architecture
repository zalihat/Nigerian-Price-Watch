Phase 1: Core ETL Resurrection
Scrape from key sources (online supermarkets, market blogs, maybe social media chatter?)

Clean + Normalize data (standard units, price formats, region tags).

Store in a solid structure—PostgreSQL or MongoDB, depending on your flavor.

Phase 2: Analytics Engine
Build your trend detection logic (moving averages, anomaly detection).

Start simple: “Price up 10% over 2 weeks” → eventually roll into predictions.

Bonus: build a "recommendation engine" for when to stock up.

Phase 3: Interface Vibes
Web dashboard (Next.js, Flask, or Django front).

Mobile-first or full-on PWA for that on-the-go user base.

Add a search bar, filters by region/item, visual charts.

Phase 4: Outreach & Growth
Add a WhatsApp bot (Twilio + Python combo is clean).

Deploy a landing page: “Get alerts when rice prices drop in your area.”

Maybe launch a weekly newsletter with insights—“Tomato Watch: Prices Expected to Drop Next Week.”

Tools you might vibe with:
BeautifulSoup/Scrapy for scraping

Pandas + Prophet/Scikit-learn for trend + prediction

Supabase or Firebase for lean backend

Streamlit for quick dashboards (to test stuff fast)

Langchain if you wanna get wild with some AI question-answering on your dataset
